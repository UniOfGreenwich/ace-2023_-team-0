# **Open-SSH connection**

OpenSSH, or Open Secure Shell, is an open-source implementation of the SSH protocol. It provides secure communication between two or more computers over an unsecured network, ensuring data exchange confidentiality and integrity. OpenSSH is widely used in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems as the standard SSH implementation for remote administration, secure file transfer, and tunnelling other network services.

In this project, Secure Shell (SSH) is employed to establish secure connections between all nodes. The OpenSSH server facilitates access from one node to another, enabling seamless communication and interaction between systems. OpenSSH is an essential component in configuring servers such as NFS and SLURM, ensuring secure and encrypted communication channels for data transfer and remote management tasks.
