## Introduction
---todo

## Step 1: Define Requirements

1. Purpose of the HPC System
2. Performance Requirements
   Determine the performance specifications required for the applications, including processing power, memory, storage, and interconnectivity.

## Step 2: Hardware Components

1. Motherboards
2. Single board computers
3. Processor (CPU)
   Select CPUs based on performance requirements. Consider multi-core processors for parallel processing.
4. Memory (RAM)
   Choose sufficient RAM for each node to handle the workload efficiently.
5. Storage:
   Decide on the storage configuration, considering the need for fast access times. SSDs are commonly used for HPC systems.
6. Network Interconnect:
   Choose a high-speed network interconnect, such as InfiniBand or 10/25/40/100 Gigabit Ethernet, depending on your needs.
   ### Interconnect
         --Cluster Network is two or more computing device working together for a common computing purpose. This Network follows the principle of the parallel processing. Parallel processing is the method of using two or more processors(CPUs) to handle seperate chuncks of a same complex tasks.
      
      In today's time, most computer have multi-cores (i.e., anywhere from two to tewelve cores) which follows the concept of parallel processing. These multi-cores set-ups are similar to having seperate processors installed in a same computer, which can executes more tasks than a single-core processors. In HPC, this concept is extended to multiple nodes, each equipped with its own set of processors where large computational tasks is broken down into smaller sub-tasks that can be executed simultaneously by multile processor at a same time. 

      High-Speed interconnect are crucial for High-Performance Computer(HPC), as we want high data analysis and transfer rate between two nodes to move large amount of data quickly. Along with data transfer, low latency is equally imporatant in HPC, to minimize the time it takes for data to travel between different components of the system. If designing  stock prediction system, developing accurate models often requires extensive training and optimization processes. High-speed interconnects facilitate the rapid exchange of information during these iterative processes, allowing the model to be trained and refined more quickly. 

      There are several interconnect technologies available with their own strength and specefic use-cases. Some of them are :
      
      1. **Infiniband** : Computer Networking communication standard used in high-performance computing that features high throughput and very low latency. It supports Remote Direct Memory Access(RDMA), which means the ability to access host memory directly without CPU intervention. Infiniband is widely used in supercomputer clusters and it is preferred network interconnection technology for GPU servers.
      2. **NVIDIA NVLink** : World's first high-speed GPU interconnect technology that can connect two graphics card , with low latency, and high bandwidth. It is ideal for the system that uses NVIDIA graphics card, such as those in deep-learning and GPU accelerated computing. It is not best option for our project,as it is only compatible with NVIDIA graphics card and we will be using intel graphics card for our HPC.
      3. **Intel Omni-Path Architecture(OPA)** : OPA is communication architecture developed by intel which aims for low communication latency, low power consumption and a high throughput. It is often used for HPC application with Intel processor. OPA directly competes with infiniband.
      4. **Ethernet** : Ethernet is one of the commonly used interconnect technology because of its versatility, scalability and compatibility.It migh not provide same low-latency level as specialised interconnect like infiniband but it provides various speed, ranging from 10 megabyte to 100 gigabyte per second.    

      The type of interconnect technology one needs lies on what kind of system they are building and what kind of interconnect is compatible with the system. For our system, specefication and hardware is given above.


# Install Operating System in Head Node
Initially, an attempt was made to determine which operating system the ASUS CS-B motherboard supports. However, the information available suggests that the ASUS CS-B is only compatible with Ubuntu 13.10, as indicated in the provided image.
![Os](https://github.com/TeachingMaterial/ace-2023_-team-0/assets/85470428/3f1fbdae-3522-4e26-841c-ef19f4888d5a)
Figure: OS Compatibility of Asus CS-B 

1. Once the operating system was determined, below steps are followed to install ubuntu desktop 13.10:
      - Downloaded the Ubuntu Desktop from the official Ubuntu website (https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/13.10/). As Intel processor is used, PC (Intel x86) desktop image is chosen when downloading the image.
      - Created a bootable USB drive using Rufus.
      - Booted the motherboard from the USB drive.
      - Followed the installation wizard to install Ubuntu Desktop on the system.

2. After the installation process, the system undergoes a series of commands to ensure it possesses the latest security patches and software updates:

                                                                  `(sudo apt update
                                                                                                                                          
                                                                  sudo apt upgrade)`

3. Given its role as the head node in our setup, the desktop image is transformed into a server. Let's quickly delve into the significance of the head node within the realm of High-Performance Computing (HPC).

- The head node serves as a central control unit in an HPC environment, orchestrating and managing the entire cluster. Its primary purposes include task scheduling, resource allocation, and overall coordination of computational tasks within the cluster. By installing      the Ubuntu Server and setting the default target to multi-user mode optimize resource allocation, conserving RAM and CPU resources by eschewing unnecessary graphical sessions. This ensures that the head node operates efficiently, enabling it to efficiently manage and    oversee the computational workload of the entire HPC cluster.
  
                                                To install Ubuntu Server  : (`sudo apt install ubuntu-server`)
                                                To disable GUI            : (`sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target`)
     
Although the documentation states that the ASUS CS-B motherboard can only run Ubuntu 13.10, a brief test was run to see how the motherboard would react to installing Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish), a more recent version of the operating system. The Ubuntu 22.04       
operating system ran on the system very well, with no noticeable glitches. This surprising finding prompted more investigation into the motherboard's compatibility with the latest Ubuntu versions. 
Although documentation indicates otherwise, one plausible explanation for Ubuntu 22.04's successful running on the ASUS CS-B motherboard could be the hardware compatibility enhancements included in later Ubuntu editions. The Ubuntu operating system is continuously       improved and optimised by its developers throughout time to improve compatibility with a wider variety of hardware setups. Because of this, more recent versions of Ubuntu might by nature support a greater range of motherboards, including the ASUS CS-B. Moreover,         improvements in system libraries, kernel updates, and device drivers in Ubuntu 22.04 can also be responsible for its smooth operation on the ASUS CS-B motherboard. These updates might take care of any compatibility problems that earlier motherboard models might have     had, making it possible to use current Ubuntu editions more smoothly.
After noticing that Ubuntu 22.04 operated steadily on the ASUS CS-B motherboard, the group chose to switch from Ubuntu 13.10 to this more recent version. This choice was driven by the goal of utilising Ubuntu 22.04's most recent software features, security updates,      and hardware compatibility changes to provide the best possible computing environment for the team's activities.

# Install Operating System in Compute Node
The process of installing the operating system on a compute node is similar to that of the head node, with the exception that it is not required the installation of Ubuntu Server specifically.

# Original Design For The HPC Case
The original design for the case consisted of 3D printing of all components needed. This included the shelves, floor, roof, and side/back panels of the case. Multiple aspects have to be considered when designing the case such as the components requirements, ventilation, and accessibility. All original shelf and case piece that have been uploaded were designed to be durable and well ventilated and were easily connected together using a pin system

## Problems Encountered
While waiting to receive the initial components from 3d printing I was informed that it would take to long to 3d print all my required components as there were many other students looking to 3d print components at this time Aswell. To solve this issue, we decided to order the shell of our case and print the brackets and laser cut the shelves as well as the front and back panels in stead of printing all the components

# Chosen Shell  
The case we ordered was a 21U tall server racking system which was perfect for the purpose of our projects. It came with slots all down the left and ride side of the case which ensured enough ventilation for the fans to disperse the heat 

![Shell](case.jpeg)<br>
<b>Figure 1:Case</b>
<br><br>

The 1U brackets were 3d printed in order to hold the acrylic shelves that were laser cut. They were mounted in the holes that were ment for the racking system of the case. An extension cord was placed at the back and mounted to the top of the case. Whis acted as a way to limit the amount of cables that would exit the case. Instead, we could power each of the motherboards power sources internally 

![Push button](brackets.jpeg)<br>
<b>Figure 1:3D printed brakets </b>
<br><br>

The front and back of the case was laser cut in acrylic with 120x120 fan holes at the base and the top in order to mount the fan to then in a way that allowed them to get a strong enough air pull. Hence the small circles that fill the 120x120 frame. the back panel was made to be slightly smaller to allow room for the extension cord

# Other alterations
Rubber feet will be used on the motherboards and the SSDs to limit the directs contact onto the shelves to allow air underneath the boards when necessary. The extension cable will run down the side of the case into an outlet. The power button will drill through the roof of the case to allow Instant power to the application we have also decided to cover the back of the case to limit the light inside the case to utilize the led fans. All power supply will plug directly into the extension cord build into the case
